# Green Fingers
## Gardening and Outdoor Maintenance Services

## About

**Green Fingers** is a ficticious gardening and outdoor maintenance company who require a B2C website to promote their services. 
The sight is designed to inform potential users and customers of the services they provide and to showcase their previous work which is of high quality tradesmanship. The website also aims to prompt the user to contact the business with a 'Call to Action' form on the 'Contact Us' page. 

The site is designed to look professional, but avoid a corporate appearance, given that the target user is private home owners, potentially young working professionals, who are time poor and who have disposable income. The website is responsive and accessible on a range of devices to ensure maximum user experience regardless of the device they are using.
